This experience alienated a lot of our audience, opened BuzzFeed up to legal consequences, and just didn\u2019t align with our mission to spread truth and joy to the entire internet. The tech organization became strongly invested in having an accessible experience accredited by experts, and we needed to amend these issues as quickly as possible. More importantly, we needed to learn how to create a culture of accessibility so that this experience was not recreated years down the road.","solution":"We first got to work addressing a lot of the semantic issues present on our site. I worked on fixing a lot of semantic markup issues on core rendering services, usually working with lots of different JS frameworks to refactor parts of the site to reflect best a11y practices. I also helped with the technical adoption of alt text into BuzzFeed quizzes, various workflows for our internal CMS and internal tools, and helped encourage its adoption across the content organization. Myself and other engineers within the tech organization now collaborate with content editors to help them write better alt text, and are establishing more standard a11y patterns into the code that powers BuzzFeed.","timePeriod":"June 2019 - Present (( a11y never ends! ))","description":"Improving BuzzFeed\'s web accessibility to provide an equitable experience for all.","route":"a11y-at-buzzfeed","technologiesUsed":["React","jQuery","T3.js","Backbone.js","HTML","SCSS"],"relatedLink":{"link":"https://tech.buzzfeed.com/accessible-buzzfeed-2e1f3f94f352","text":"Accessible BuzzFeed"},"video":{"src":"/videos/a11y_at_buzzfeed.mov","ariaLabel":"Screen capture of the process of adding alt text to BuzzFeed content","posterSrc":"/videos/posters/a11y_at_buzzfeed.png"}},{"projectTitle":"BF Paint","role":"Hackathon team member","background":"At BuzzFeed, folks in the tech organization have a tradition of playing virtual Pictionary every Friday, as a way to have fun and be chaotic with coworkers. Sadly, we noticed there were a lot of shortcomings with our previous choice of pictionary application. We weren\'t able to play in a single game with more than 11 people, U.S slang frequently confused a lot of our non-American engineers, and it frankly didn\'t feel as \\"BuzzFeed-y\\".","solution":"During our <a href=\\"https://tech.buzzfeed.com/best-of-hack-week-2020-42df16471d0d\\">2020 Hack Week</a>, some other engineers and I built our own Pictionary web application themed \xe0 la Windows 98, using React, Redux, Node and Socket.io, that featured real-time chat, fuzzy word matching, and even AI-powered word detection. I wrote the real-time room joining functionality, and helped write the state management logic between the server, rooms and the users within the rooms. It was a really interesting lesson in seeing how various parts of state had to be maintained as data flowed in a big event-based system, and the end product was ridiculously cool!","timePeriod":"August 2020","description":"Pictionary, but make it Windows 98 themed.","route":"bf-paint","technologiesUsed":["React","Redux","Socket.io","SCSS","Node"],"relatedLink":{"link":"https://tech.buzzfeed.com/best-of-hack-week-2020-42df16471d0d","text":"Best of BuzzFeed\'s Hack Week 2020"},"video":{"src":"/videos/bf_paint.mov","ariaLabel":"Player drawing clues for the word beanstalk on the BF Paint interface."},"images":[{"path":"/videos/posters/bf_paint.png","altText":"Drawings and emojis on the BF Paint user interface."}]},{"projectTitle":"hackNY","company":"hackNY","role":"Director of Admissions","background":"hackNY is a non-profit dedicated to empowering the next generation of student technologists in New York City. Every year, about 20 fellows are chosen to be part of a class that lives in New York City, interns with local startups, and works on technical social good projects on the side. I was part of the hackNY class of 2019, and I stepped up to serve as Director of Admissions for the class of 2020.","solution":"I facilitated and created a review process for over 2,300 applications, conducted lots of technical and behavioral interviews, and ended up admitting a class of 24 wonderful fellows. This was a really interesting job of mine, simply because it wasn\'t technical, and the daunting task of choosing a cool, unique class from such an intimidatingly large pool wasn\'t one that anyone could tell me how to do. I had to develop fair admissions policies, learn how to holistically assess people while minimizing bias, and overall, just learn how to organize complex situations with little/no background. I regularly had to fix urgent, client-facing incidents on the fly, and successfully worked with my team of over 50 volunteers to achieve our desired goal, which directly taught me more about ownership and leadership than any other job of mine.","timePeriod":"August 2019 - July 2020","description":"Building community dedicated to combining tech with social good.","route":"hackNY","relatedLink":{"link":"https://medium.com/hackny/announcing-the-class-of-2020-hackny-fellows-f594c173aff6","text":"Announcing the hackNY Class of 2020!"},"images":[{"path":"/images/hackNY_logo.png","altText":""},{"path":"/images/hackNY_2019.jpg","altText":"The hackNY class of 2019 smiles for a picture in their hoodies."}]},{"projectTitle":"Site Navigation Admin Tool","company":"BuzzFeed","role":"Fullstack Engineering Intern","background":"Before this service was implemented, editors and content creators on BuzzFeed had to request a code change everytime they wanted to change a trending topic on the primary site header. However, analyses on traffic referred from the site header were done, and we found that there was a potential for increased clickthrough if the site header could be more dynamic, and stay up to date with the zeitgeist. However, the code-change workflow involved with changing these topics was too slow, and wasted precious engineering time.","solution":"I built a self-service curation tool for content editors to change these topics on the site header, completely ad-hoc on any international homepage, using AWS S3, Node, and React. I implemented local caching and polling mechanisms to reduce operational cost & API usage, created a slackbot reliant on distributed messaging architecture, and developed a REST API to handle configuration update & storage logic.

Program participants would receive lesson modules, fill them out, and send them back to be graded and advance forward. However, the workflow designed for employees to manage participants, modules and mailing state involved manually updating spreadsheets, which was time-intensive, human error-prone, and infeasible with scale.","solution":"My team and I built a web dashboard to manage users and their mail in a more streamlined and cost-efficient way. We needed the solution to practically run for free, so we used Serverless framework as well as the Airtable API to get around having no server and database. We then built an Express server to expose functional endpoints to our frontend.

Cognitive Toybox is a small startup in Brooklyn dedicated to creating educational assessment games for low-income neighborhood schools. Once Cognitive Toybox had released their product into schools, they found that they had little observability into how their product was being used, making further product iteration difficult and and mysterious.","solution":"My team and I decided to build a fullstack web application using React, Node, and various AWS tools to help them visualize trends in the data they collect from schools, so they could unlock further potential with their product.

The previous cron-based system of transaction processing led to lags in data, sources of truth for certain data had become forgotten, and other certain deeply-rooted issues just made maintenance a hassle for everyday engineers. It represented some burning technical debt, and there was an estimated ~$10 million in potential revenue  and unlocked business opportunities if we could deliver a much better API.","solution":"Our team wrote a new financial invoicing API that relied on distributed messaging using Kafka as well as API endpoints written using PHP and GraphQL, redesigning how the data was represented and making the pipeline work asynchronously. I was able to write some GraphQL resolvers to query and integrate a lot of disparate data sources, so we could present one flexible, version-independent endpoint to clients.
